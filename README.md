# Landing-Page
This is the landing page project for the Odin Project. It will involve HTML and CSS, designing four parts of a website in a standard form. Header, content, navigation and footer. It will also require flex box, styling and other CSS elements that are somewhat tricky.

Currently struggling to get my placeholder image to display inline. The confusing thing is that img elements are usually inline and I'm not sure what I've done or how to correct this issue.

Struggled getting things to render correctly in changing space. I'm sure this is due to my difficulty using flex-grow, shrink and basis elements.
